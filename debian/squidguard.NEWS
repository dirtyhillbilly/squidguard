squidguard (1.2.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Squidguard now uses DB4.3. Rebuild your blacklist databases.
    You need to make sure that you rebuild all your Squidguard blacklists
    otherwise Squidguard and ultimatly Squid may not function properly. 
    Unless you have disabled it during installation, any blacklists listed
    in /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf will be rebuilt. You can use
    /usr/sbin/update-squidguard to manually perform a rebuild.
