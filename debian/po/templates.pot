"Rebuilding the blacklist databases is time consuming and under some "
"circumstances could cause problems.  With the breakout of individual "
"blacklist section packages the time it takes for each package to rebuild "
"will be extensive.  Also it may not be desireable to rebuild these databases "
"on production servers.  You can manually perform a rebuild by running /usr/"
"sbin/update-squidguard."
