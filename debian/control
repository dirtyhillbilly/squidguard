Description: filter, redirector and access controller plug for Squid
 squidGuard is a free (GPL), flexible and ultra fast filter, redirector
 and access controller plugin for squid.  It lets you define multiple
 access rules with different restrictions for different user groups on
 a squid cache.  squidGuard uses squid's standard redirector interface.
